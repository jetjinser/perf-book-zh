# Parallelism

Rust provides excellent support for safe parallel programming, which can lead
to large performance improvements. There are a variety of ways to introduce
parallelism into a program and the best way for any program will depend greatly
on its design. 

An in-depth treatment of parallelism is beyond the scope of this book. If you
are interested in this topic, the documentation for the [`rayon`] and
[`crossbeam`] crates is a good place to start.
